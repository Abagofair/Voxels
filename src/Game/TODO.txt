#1 Better handling of a window resize - rendertarget texture resize? glViewport?
#3 scene export/import
#4 better shader / scene material handling (maybe do before #3)
#5 better camera abstraction (literally copy+paste right now)
#6 different input contexts - e.g. GameWindow in editor is active vs inactive, menu vs ingame
#7 screen to world object selection and highlighting
#8 optimize voxel chunk rendering - reduce amount of blocks, merge meshes, utilize instances
